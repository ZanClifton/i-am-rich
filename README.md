# I Am Rich

My first Flutter project and a work in progress.

Inspired by the original ["I Am Rich"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Am_Rich) app, though I won't be putting it in the App Store for $999.99.

## Creating A Local Copy

### ✔️ 1. CLONE THE REPO

Terminal Commands:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/ZanClifton/i-am-rich.git
$ cd i-am-rich
```

### ✔️ 2. IDE

![Android Studio](https://img.shields.io/badge/Android%20Studio-3DDC84.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=android-studio&logoColor=white) ![Xcode](https://img.shields.io/badge/Xcode-007ACC?style=for-the-badge&logo=Xcode&logoColor=white)

You will need an IDE to run this project locally. I recommend Android Studio as it has the ability to create an emulator to run the app, or Xcode if you are using a Mac.
